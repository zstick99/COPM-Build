Credit to SSK and KingJigglypuff, along with ilikepizza107, for the PSA edits, allowing for sword glows on a specific costume. Changes are further detailed below

FitMarth.pac uses P+ 3.0.2 FitMarth.pac, with the following edits:

Added Subroutine 2x7918 - Cotains an If/Else block to use custom sword trail and glow model if on costume 40, and to use the normal trail and glow model otherwise. (For most main attacks)
Added Subroutine 2x7968 - Cotains an If/Else block to use custom sword trail and glow model if on costume 40, and to use the normal trail and glow model otherwise. (For most getup type attacks and counter hit)
Added Subroutine 2x7B30 - Cotains an If/Else block to use custom sword trail and glow model if on costume 40, and to use the normal trail and glow model otherwise. (For most final smash subactions)

Added texture eff_marth_sword_flare_custom for custom sword glow model
Added new Model Data [3] that contains an extra custom sword glow model using the eff_marth_sword_flare_custom texture for its color
Added extra EFLS node that uses BRRES 3(model data 3) to properly allow for the new sword glow model
Added Custom Effect bank 44 to Marth containing an extra trail texture for his regular and shield breaker slashes. Associated sword trail ids are 335 and 336, in that order.
If desired to change the custom effect bank, use this link to know what to rename the textures and bank, as well as what the new sword trail ids will be: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16CSOk-aEq-85Bm2V0kWNfKRZ5_Py0MPj7dMhGcf6ylE/edit#gid=80906371
